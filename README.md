# universal-silent-aim
this silent aim only works with weapons that use raycasting! therefore games like prison life that use findpartonraywithignorelist or other deprecated variants wont be supported!

# update v2
i added highlight and notification features to the silent aim and improved stability, have fun!
(also added for you to check ur settings by checking in console simple stuff by pretty nice i guess)

loadstring: ```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harvox/universal-silent-aim/refs/heads/main/source.lua"))()```
