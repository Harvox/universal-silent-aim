# universal-silent-aim
this silent aim only works with weapons that use raycasting! therefore games like prison life that use findpartonraywithignorelist or other deprecated variants wont be supported!

loadstring: ```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harvox/universal-silent-aim/refs/heads/main/source.lua"))()```

# update v2
i added highlight and notification features to the silent aim, have fun!
